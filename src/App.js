He is overweight, lazy, and ignorant, but also strongly devoted to his wife and children. He works as a low level safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, in Sector 7G, although he's often incompetent, mostly sleeps on duty and eats the donuts provided. He spends a great deal of his time at Moe's Tavern with his lifelong friends Barney, Carl, Lenny, and bartender Moe Szyslak. At home he can often be found sitting on the sofa mindlessly watching TV while snacking on food and drinking Duff beer."} pict={'https://static.simpsonswiki.com/images/b/bd/Homer_Simpson.png'}/>

With her husband Homer, she has three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie Simpson. Marge is the moralistic force in her family and often provides a grounding voice in the midst of her family's antics by trying to maintain order in the Simpson household. Aside from her duties at home, Marge flirted briefly with a number of careers ranging from police officer to anti-violence activist."} pict={'https://static.simpsonswiki.com/images/0/0b/Marge_Simpson.png'}/>

      <SimpsonComponent name={'Lisa'} info={"Lisa Marie[4] Simpson (born May 9[5]) is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard achievement level of children her age.

In school, Lisa's popularity's affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a few friends. Lisa Simpson's a smart, witty, independent girl who focuses on her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at age 8 she's already a member of MENSA with an IQ of 159."} pict={'https://static.simpsonswiki.com/images/e/ec/Lisa_Simpson.png'}/>
